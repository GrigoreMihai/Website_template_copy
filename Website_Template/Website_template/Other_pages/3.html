        <h2>
              
              1.Brocoli
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;display:inline-block;">
            When it comes to great-tasting nutrition, broccoli is an all-star food with many health benefits. 
            While low in calories, broccoli is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, in addition to fiber.

 Broccoli contains sulforophane, a sulfur-containing compound .
 Researchers are studying the anti-cancer properties of sulforophane and
  have come to some interesting conclusions, although more research is needed. 

As if that's not enough, a cup of cooked broccoli offers as much vitamin C as an orange, and is a good 
source of beta-carotene. Broccoli contains vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc too.
 It also provides fiber and is low in calories.

    2.Garlic
</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;display: inline-block">
                The combined effects on reducing cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as the 
                antioxidant properties, may reduce the risk of common brain diseases like Alzheimer's 
                disease and dementia . Summary Garlic contains antioxidants that protect against cell damage and aging.

        <h2>
               
            3.Lemons
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            You may have heard the importance of drinking a glass of lemon water every morning, and this is 
            because lemon helps conserve insulin, allowing your body to take more time to take in and process nutrients after eating.

Drinking hot water with lemon not only helps digestion, but it can help reduce bloating and may even help boost your mood.
Lemon contains a compound called naringenin, which can help reduce liver inflammation. It also contains eriocitrin, 
a flavonoid that helps protect the liver against oxidative stress.

        <h2>
            4.Berries
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            When it comes to health, berries have a fabulous reputation. Blueberries are packed with antioxidants, called anthocyanins,
             that may help keep memory sharp as you age, and raspberries contain ellagic acid, a compound with anti-cancer properties. All 
             berries are great sources of fiber, a nutrient important for a healthy digestive system. But if you need more reasons to dig
              into summer’s sun-kissed little fruits, 
            look no further than two new studies, which suggest that berries may be good for your heart and your bones as well.

            5.Nuts
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, pecans — nuts are a good source of
             plant protein. They also contain monounsaturated fats, which may be a factor in reducing the risk of heart disease.
